The most secure sc hedule classi cation is 2C. Ho w ev er, this ma y lead to un- manageably large master k eys for ciphers whose securit y cannot hop e to matc h what is naiv ely suggested b y the k ey length. F urther, exp ort restrictions on cryptographic materials often limit the size of the k ey . F or these reasons, the b est w e can hop e for is to mimic 2C sc hedules as closely as p ossible, with the next strongest classi cation, 2B.
