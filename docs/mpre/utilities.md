Average
--------
 usage: Average([name=''], [size=20], 
                       [values=tuple()], [meta_average=False]) => average_object
                       
        Average objects keep a running average via the add method.
        The size option specifies the maximum number of samples. When
        this limit is reached, additional samples will result in the
        oldest sample being removed.
        
        values may be used to seed the average.
        
        The meta_average boolean flag is used to determine whether or not
        to keep an average of the average - This is implemented by an
        additional Average object.

LRU_Cache
--------
A dictionary with a max size that keeps track of
       key usage and handles key eviction. 
       
       currently completely untested

Latency
--------
 usage: Latency([name="component_name"], 
                       [average_size=20]) => latency_object
                       
        Latency objects possess a latency attribute that marks
        the average time between calls to latency.update()
