What is pride
------------
Pride stands for "python runtime and integrated development environment". 
Pride offers various python modules and a dynamic software environment that
aim to increase the rate at which complete, high quality applications can be 
produced. Using pride, you can develop concurrent, secure, multi-user ready
applications in a minimal amount of time.

Some application features that pride supports "out of the box" include:
    
- User to User level communication
    - Forget tcp/ip network sockets!
    - Pride features a secure remote procedure call portal, with a data 
      transfer service built on top
        - Just register with the data transfer service and you can send
          data directly to any other registered users. 
            - All networking and security is handled elsewhere
    - A host proof data transfer service is being planned/developed
    
- Effortless concurrency
    - "Regular" python does not feature indirection (aka references or "pointers")
    - All Base objects in pride have a reference
        - Similar to a well known name in dbus, if you're familiar
    - References are "dereferenced" via the pride.objects dictionary  
        - The dictionary keys are string references
        - The dictionary values the object that the string references
    - All operations take place in a single thread and may proceed as
      though they are atomic*
        - No mutexes, locks, semaphores, coroutines, or stack frame
          switches are required
    - Just grab the component you need from the objects dictionary
      when you need it, then let it fall out of scope
      
- Base objects have an explicit destructor: the delete method
    - Guaranteed that object.delete() will garbage collect the object
        - As long as there's no references to the literal object, anyways!
        
- Saving/loading 
    - Done securely, without pickle
    - Can be performed at arbitrary points of program execution
    
- Updating
    - Components can be updated from source at runtime without restart
    
- Easy to use crypto
    - User objects feature encrypt/decrypt methods
        - Always uses authenticated encryption
        - Fits the cannonical interface: ciphertext = user.encrypt(plaintext)
            - Returns a cryptogram; decryption is plaintext = user.decrypt(ciphertext)
                - Cryptogram includes all information, such as iv and 
                  required algorithms
        - Support for unencrypted authenticated associated data
    
    - Or, even easier, encrypted database file objects:
        - Can read and write, and use as a context manager just like a normal file
            - Writes are buffered to memory and encrypted when the file is saved
                - File is stored inside a database, and not directly in the file system
                    - Filenames can be obfuscated                            
    
- Never waste time rolling another argument parser again!
    - Components can receive attributes from the command line, just by
      supplying parse_args=True to the objects initialization.
    - Supported attributes are determined by the objects default attributes        
    
- Site config support
    - All objects can be customized to fit the needs of where they are
      deployed.
        - Any new default settings can be set here
    - Support for permanent entries
    - Support for single run entries via the command line with --site_config
    
- Alpha support for graphical applications
    - Black box services run the application code on the server
        - The client simply sends keystrokes/clicks and receives 
          instructions for what to render to the screen    
    - All black box applications have multi user support by default

- Simple logging and verbose output control
    - Simply supply your message and a level flag to the alert method
        - Try using Base objects verbosity dictionary to dispatch your level flags
            - Then you can modify them via the --site_config flag
                - Good if you ever need to quickly up the level for debugging without
                  having to resort to editting the code.
    - Globally filter alert levels via the command line flag: --print_level
        - accepts args in the form: 0+v+vv+vvv+special_flag+....
            - Creates a set of flags that levels will be tested against
            - 0 represents errors and messages for the user
                - Use 0 for things that should always be displayed
            - Incrementing quantities of 'v' indicate progressively 
              verbose messages
                - These are relative and assigned at your discretion
            - Special flags can be used for alerts you wish to single out
                - Sometimes you just want one alert, and not a class of 
                  equally verbose messages
    - Similar to messages printed to stdout, there is a log_level flag
        - Functions exactly the same way as print_level, except that output
          goes to the alert handlers log file instead of stdout
        
- Builtin command line interface
    - Allows you to explore and interact with your program while it runs
    - Due to the client server model everything runs on, this can be used 
      for convenient python style ssh for remote machine management
    - Supports python interpreter and os shell by default
    - Extensible with more programs
        - Including "Screensavers"!
          

Q: How is it licensed?
   
    A: Pride is currently licensed under the GPL. If this ruined your day, let me know why and maybe we can figure something out.
  
Q: Where can I learn more?

    A: Investigate https://github.com/erose1337/pride or jump straight into the documentation at http://erose1337.github.io/pride/
        Be warned, documentation is still under development! 
        If in doubt, read the source. 
        If still in doubt, email the author.
   
Q: What are the dependencies?
    
    A: Python 2.7+ is required. 
       - The "cryptography" python package and Openssl are required, but...
            - There is a "dummy" crypto module for those with install permission issues
                - It's going to be pretty slow, relatively speaking
                - Strongly discouraged for production
                - Great if you just wanted to try it out
                
       Optional packages require additional dependencies:
       1. Low level audio support requires pyalsaaudio on linux or pyaudio otherwise
       2. SDL support requires SDL2.0 and pysdl2

    A: Tell me about it and I'll do my best to get back to you: erose1337@hotmail.com


*Technically, the framework uses a second thread for non blocking keyboard 
input. However, this is transparent, and users of prides api will not require 
or be aware of any threading.
